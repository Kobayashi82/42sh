# Internal Code Documentation: `bg.c`

[TOC]

## 1. Introduction

This document details the implementation of the `bg.c` file,  part of the 42sh project.  This file's primary function is (presumably, based on the filename) to manage background processes within the shell.  The current implementation, however, only contains header information and an include statement.  Further documentation will be added as the code is implemented.

## 2. Included Header

The file includes the `42sh.h` header file. This header file presumably contains necessary definitions, structures, and function prototypes for the 42sh shell.


## 3. Function Details

Currently, no functions are defined within `bg.c`.  This section will be expanded as the code is developed.  The following table will list the functions, their purpose, and their algorithmic details once implemented:


| Function Name | Purpose                               | Algorithm                                                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 4. Data Structures

Currently, no custom data structures are defined within `bg.c`. This section will be expanded as needed.


## 5. Future Development

Future development will include the implementation of functions to manage background processes.  This will likely involve:

*   **Process Management:**  Functions to launch processes in the background, track their status, and handle signals.
*   **Job Control:**  Mechanisms to list, resume, and kill background jobs.
*   **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling for various scenarios such as process creation failures or signal handling issues.

This documentation will be updated to reflect these additions as they are implemented.
