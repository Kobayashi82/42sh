## 1. Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This document provides internal documentation for the `builtin.c` file.  Currently, the file only contains an include statement and header comments.  No functions are defined within this file.  Further documentation will be added as functionality is implemented.


## 2. Included Header <a name="included-header"></a>

| Header File       | Description                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `"42sh.h"`        | Contains definitions and declarations for the 42sh shell. This likely includes structures, function prototypes, and macros used throughout the shell's implementation.  Further details require examination of the `42sh.h` file itself. |


**Note:**  The provided code snippet is primarily header information and lacks any function implementations.  This documentation will be expanded as the `builtin.c` file is developed.  Future sections will detail individual functions, algorithms, and data structures.
